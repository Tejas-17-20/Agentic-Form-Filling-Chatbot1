# Agentic-Form-Filling-Chatbot1


## Overview
The Agentic Form-Filling Chatbot is an intelligent system designed to assist users in completing complex forms (such as legal documents or insurance claims) through a conversational interface. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from user responses and dynamically populate the corresponding form fields, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Features
- *Intuitive Chat Interface*: User-friendly chat interface that guides users through the form-filling process.
- *Dynamic Form Updates*: Real-time updates of form fields based on user input received via the chatbot.
- *Natural Language Understanding*: Implements robust NLP techniques for accurate information extraction.
- *Error Handling*: Provides informative error messages and validation to guide users.
- *Accessibility*: Designed to be accessible for users with disabilities.

   git clone https://github.com/Tejas-17-20/agentic-form-filling-chatbot1.git
   cd agentic-form-filling-chatbot


   
Implementation Approach and Key Design Decisions
Framework Choice: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use in developing web applications, allowing rapid prototyping and deployment.
NLP Library: The chatbot utilizes the spaCy library for natural language processing. SpaCy provides robust features for tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and dependency parsing, which are essential for interpreting user inputs.
Dynamic Form Logic: The form fields are designed to be populated dynamically based on the conversation flow. JavaScript is used on the front end to listen for changes and update the form in real time, ensuring consistency between user inputs and the displayed form.
State Management: Context awareness is achieved by storing user responses in a session, allowing the chatbot to reference previous inputs and provide relevant follow-up questions.



NLP and Information Extraction Techniques Used
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot employs several NLP techniques to accurately interpret user inputs:
Tokenization: Splitting user inputs into individual words or phrases to analyze structure.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and categorizing key information such as names, dates, and locations from user responses.
Intent Recognition: Classifying user messages to determine appropriate follow-up questions and actions.
Contextual Memory: The chatbot maintains a record of previous interactions, allowing it to reference earlier inputs when necessary and guide users through the form-filling process effectively.


Challenges Faced and Solutions
Handling Ambiguous Inputs: Users sometimes provide unclear or vague responses. To address this, I implemented follow-up questions that ask for clarification and additional details, ensuring that the chatbot gathers accurate information before proceeding.
Real-time Form Updates: There were initial challenges with updating form fields in real time based on user input. This was resolved by ensuring that the front-end JavaScript correctly handled data sent from the backend and updated the DOM accordingly.
Error Handling Mechanisms: Developing a robust error-handling system was essential for user experience. I implemented validation checks to catch invalid inputs and provided users with clear instructions on how to correct their responses.
Accessibility Compliance: Ensuring that the chat interface was accessible to users with disabilities was a significant focus. I used semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to improve accessibility and conducted user testing to identify areas for improvement.


Future Improvements or Extensions
Enhanced NLP Techniques: Integrating more advanced NLP models (such as transformers) could improve understanding and response generation, making the chatbot more versatile in handling user queries.
Multilingual Support: Extending the chatbot’s capabilities to support multiple languages, thereby increasing accessibility for a broader audience.
Feedback Mechanism: Adding a user feedback system where users can rate their experience and provide input on the chatbot’s responses, helping to improve future interactions.
Data Persistence: Implementing a database to store user responses for later retrieval and analysis, enabling personalized interactions in subsequent sessions.
Progress Tracking Features: Developing a visual indicator of form completion progress to keep users informed about their status in the form-filling process
